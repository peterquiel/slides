=== What is Karate?

[quote, Peter Thomas]
Karate is the only open-source tool to combine API test-automation, [...]. The BDD syntax popularized by Cucumber is language-neutral, and easy for even non-programmers.

=== In short

It's an external DSL for Web-Services Testing using a Gherkin like syntax.

* External means, it's a DSL. 
* true DSL need tool support, syntax highlighting. That's the part i'm working on, hope to finish that soon. 
* Karate doesn't have true IDE support - yet. 
* And since 0.9.4 - web testing via web drivers are supported as well.

[.step, role="no-bullet"]
* In the days where computers were new..
* ...there was a game called *Karateka* with simple graphics...
* ...seeing *Karateka* for the first time in the 80's was a career-defining moment for him...
* ...in Dec 2016, no popular software was called Karate...
* ...so, lets called it Karate and use a cool logo...
* ...after a https://twitter.com/jmechner/status/838437530525659136[chat with Jordan], if he could use his logo...
* ...and he answered: "for a good nonprofit cause, I think the lawyers will look the other way..."
