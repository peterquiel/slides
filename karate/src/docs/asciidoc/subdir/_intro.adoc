=== What is Karate?

[quote, Peter Thomas]
Karate is the only open-source tool to combine API test-automation, [...]. The BDD syntax popularized by Cucumber is language-neutral, and easy for even non-programmers.

=== In short

It's an external DSL for Web-Services Testing using a Gherkin like syntax.

* External means, it's a DSL. 
* true DSL need tool support, syntax highlighting. That's the part i'm working on, hope to finish that soon. 
* Karate doesn't have true IDE support - yet. 
* And since 0.9.4 - web testing via web drivers are supported as well.

=== Some Facts

* Started as an internal project in Dec 2016 at https://www.intuit.com/[Intuit] by Peter Thomas
* Went open source September 2017
* 2.6k Github stars
* almost no open bugs
* VS-Code replaced a javafx application as Karate-IDE
* Current stable version 0.9.4 

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* In 0.9.3 (?) a javafx ui for debugging was integrated. This has been replaced by a visual studio code plugin.
* Full language server support is planned.
* It's sad to say that it's almost a one man show.
* Version 1.0.0? .. I will come to that back later.

=== Karate, this isn't about material arts?

[.step, role="no-bullet"]
* In the days where computers were new..
* ...there was a game called *Karateka* with simple graphics...
* ...seeing *Karateka* for the first time in the 80's was a career-defining moment for him...
* ...in Dec 2016, no popular software was called Karate...
* ...so, lets called it Karate and use a cool logo...
* ...after a https://twitter.com/jmechner/status/838437530525659136[chat with Jordan], if he could use his logo...
* ...and he answered: "for a good nonprofit cause, I think the lawyers will look the other way..."

=== BDD, Gherkin? How does this fit together?

[quote, Jack Kinsella, https://www.jackkinsella.ie/]
Cucumber has its uses, principally as a high level analysis tool [...]. 
Cucumber, as used by the majority of Rails programmers, is no more than a clumsy wrapper over basic integration tests.

// === Why cucumber? 
// [%step]
// * Free IDE plug-ins
// * Ready to use integration
// * BDD-flavoured Given-When-Then syntax for free 
// * Karate used CucumberJVM until 0.9


// https://hackernoon.com/yes-karate-is-not-true-bdd-698bf4a9be39

// why the name and the logo, 
// how does it look like, 
// is it BDD? Why not? 
// What can it be used for? Web API, json, xml, Web
// Common with cucumber?


// Why another tool, why a dsl?

// Motivation... shape the perspective. You can of cause use RestAssured or xyz to do this, but tests are fragile.. 
// They need a careful design

// “Here are the 2 Rules of Peter Quiel Karate. Rule Number 1: ‘Karate for app quality only.’ Rule Number 2: ‘First learn rule number 1.’”

// "It's okay to lose to opponent, it's never okay to lose to fear."

// Die perspective eines Juniors müssen wir bei dem was wir schaffen im auge behalten..
