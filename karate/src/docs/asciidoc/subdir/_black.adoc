== Black Belt
"Many people after receiving black belts are considered to be expertise in their domain and they start passing on their skills to others."

[quote, Mr Miyagi]
“Better learn balance. Balance is key. Balance good, karate good. Everything good. Balance bad, better pack up, go home. Understand?”

=== Some best practices

[.step, role="no-bullet"]
* Avoid super-generic re-usable features that try to do too much
* Avoid call, results in a dependency graph
* Read larger JSONs from file
* Avoid JS, put complicated logic into Java
* Prefer match over assert
* Try to make scenarios within a feature independent
* Avoid `Thread.sleep` if at all possible. Use retry.
* Use Given/When/Then within scenarios, and particularly use When with method

=== This all could be done with XYZ..

[.step, role="no-bullet"]
* Clean code is difficult to write,.. and gets worse when changed
* Maintainable trades of readability
* All patterns that increases maintainable increase code navigation distance
* Bad production code cannot be deleted, a bad and broken test can be.
* Test code is more important than production code
* Juniors have a hard time to read 500 lines Rest-Assured-Code
