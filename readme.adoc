= Slides Repository

I use this repository to backup my presentations.

== asciidoc-gradle-revealjs-example

This folder contains a simple example based on gradle, asciidoc and revaljs.

Build the slides with:

----
gradle asciidoctorRevealJs
----

After the successfully building the slides open `build/docs/asciidocRevealJs/slides.html` with your favorite browser.
